**Guide:** Prof. Gayathri Pillai, CeNSE, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore  
**Duration:** May – Jul ’25  

**Aim:** To reduce substrate bending effects during d33 measurement and assess the effectiveness of AC and DC
poling in enhancing the piezoelectric response of thin films.

- Extracted **d33 coefficient** of AlN and PZT thin films on silicon substrates using **Laser Doppler Vibrometry (LDV)** measurements and validated results through COMSOL Multiphysics simulations.
- Introduced a **new electrode design** enabling more accurate d33 measurement in thin film over substrate.  
- Performed **AC and DC poling** of thin film PZT and optimized poling conditions to enhance the d33 value.
- Worked with **DC probe station, LDV, FE-SEM, XPS, Raman Spectroscopy** and developed understanding of fabrication processes—lithography, deposition and etching in Class 100/1000 cleanroom environment.
