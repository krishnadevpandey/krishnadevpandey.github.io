**Guide:** Manish Kumar Sinha, Scientist-E, SSPL, DRDO, Delhi  
**Duration:** Dec ’24 – Jan ’25  

**Aim:** To understand the orientation selection for Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CZT) crystal growth and effects of
poling on lead magnesium niobate-lead titanate (PMN-PT) single crystals

- Conducted literature review for selecting **(111) plane** for CZT single-crystal growth.  
- Examined effects of **pulsed and DC poling** on piezoelectric PMN-PT single crystals.  
- Analyzed **binary & ternary phase diagrams** using **Thermo-Calc**.
