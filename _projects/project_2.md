**Guide:** Prof. Sanjay Srivastava, MANIT Bhopal  
**Duration:** Jan – May ’25  

**Aim:** Synthesize, characterize, and perform DFT calculations on PZT pellets.

- Synthesized PZT using **planetary ball milling**.  
- Characterized samples using **XRD, SEM, Raman, FTIR**.  
- Performed **band gap and DOS** calculations using **Materials Studio (DFT)**.  
- Preparing a **research paper** based on this work.
