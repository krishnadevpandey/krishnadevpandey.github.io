Welcome! I am **Krishnadev Pandey**, a final-year undergraduate (B.Tech.) student in the department of Materials and Metallurgical Engineering at Maulana Azad National Institute of Technology (MANIT), Bhopal. My academic journey has been driven by a deep curiosity for materials science, especially in the domains of piezoelectric materials, semiconductor technology and mechanical behavior.

I enjoy connecting theory with experiments and simulations. My recent research has led me to work on thin‐film piezoelectrics, density functional theory (DFT), and single crystal growth that strengthened both my experimental and computational understanding of materials engineering.

I have been fortunate to collaborate with esteemed researchers:

**Prof. Gayathri Pillai (CeNSE, IISc Bengaluru)** – on extracting and optimizing the d₃₃ coefficient in thin‐film AlN and PZT using LDV and COMSOL.

**Prof. Sanjay Srivastava (MANIT Bhopal)** – on PZT synthesis, characterization, and DFT calculations.

**Manish Kumar Sinha, Scientist‐E (DRDO SSPL, Delhi)** – on crystal growth of CZT and poling behavior of PMN-PT single crystals.

Beyond materials, you can find me playing chess, cricket and discussing international diplomacy.
